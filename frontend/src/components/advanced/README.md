# Advanced Components

This folder hosts high-impact UX building blocks.

- `InfiniteScroll` – sentinel-based lazy loading wrapper.
- `VirtualizedTable` – windowed table for large row counts.
- `DragDropManager` – simple sortable list via HTML5 drag events.
- `BulkOperations` – selection + action registry for mass mutations & exports.
- `PrintPreview` – A4 styled document preview with native print integration.

Usage patterns are intentionally dependency-light to ease integration and future replacement with more robust libraries if scale dictates.
